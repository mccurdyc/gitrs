# Inspiration

- <http://myrepos.branchable.com/>
- <https://github.com/orf/git-workspace#define-your-workspace>
  - clones all repos owned by a user or org. Expects you to exclude.
    - I want to specify the repos I want to clone, not the exclusions.
    - <https://github.com/orf/git-workspace/issues/171>
  - Rust
  - nix package
  - supports config
  - supports cloning if not exist locally
  - supports delete via `archive` command. moves to an `.archived` dir when deleted
    - might ask if they be interested in a `--delete` flag to the archive command,
    or a separate `rm` command that hard removes.
  - if you run a cli command to `add`, updates config
  - decent UI

  - I like the path management
  - interface isn't great
  - Go
- <https://github.com/isacikgoz/gitbatch>
  - Go
  - Perfect UI
  - Almost perfect! Just no way to cleanup a repo
- <https://github.com/nosarthur/gita>
  - Python
  - good cli interface `gita add` and `gita rm`
  - `gita rm` doesnt remove files from disk...
- <https://davvid.github.io/garden>
  - rust
  - <https://davvid.github.io/garden/configuration.html>
  - declarative YAML config file
  - does a lot more than I need
  - not a fan of the cutesy naming
  - does it clean up a repo?
    - `garden prune`
  - doesn't have a simple, built-in command for syncing.

  - Rust. Good learning op / contributing
  - nix package
  - doesnt use a config file. just traverses a path on the fs
